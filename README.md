# FrontEndAngular

**FrontEndAngular** is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using Angular version 16.2.6. This project is designed to manage person records through a user-friendly interface, leveraging a Symfony backend to handle data operations.

## Features

- **Read**: View existing person records.
- **Update**: Edit information for existing person records.
- **Delete**: Remove person records from the system.

This application provides a seamless experience for users to manage person data effectively while demonstrating the capabilities of Angular and its integration with a Symfony backend.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
